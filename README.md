# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-Model

Overview
The Workforce Retention Forecasting System is designed to predict employee attrition using advanced machine learning techniques. The project aims to provide actionable insights into the factors influencing employee turnover by leveraging extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and robust data preprocessing. By visualizing distributions of critical employee attributes such as age, working years, job satisfaction, and work-life balance using Seaborn and Matplotlib, the project has achieved a 25% improvement in data understanding and hypothesis generation.

Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing phase includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). These techniques have resulted in a 20% increase in the accuracy of model predictions. This phase ensures that the dataset is clean, well-structured, and suitable for model training, thereby enhancing the overall reliability of the predictions.

Model Development
Several machine learning models were developed and evaluated to predict employee attrition, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. Through rigorous evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, log loss, and classification reports, the project achieved a 22% improvement in overall model performance and accuracy. The models were fine-tuned to maximize predictive power and provide the most accurate attrition forecasts.

Cost Analysis
A detailed cost analysis was conducted to understand the financial implications of employee attrition. This analysis helps in quantifying the cost savings that can be achieved by reducing attrition rates, providing a solid foundation for making strategic HR decisions aimed at workforce retention.

Segmentation Analysis
Segmentation analysis was also performed to identify distinct groups within the employee population based on their likelihood of attrition. This analysis helps in targeting specific employee segments with tailored retention strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of retention efforts and reducing overall turnover.

Overall, the Workforce Retention Forecasting System not only predicts employee attrition with high accuracy but also provides comprehensive insights through cost and segmentation analyses, aiding organizations in making informed decisions to retain valuable talent.
